* [ ] You have read [the Leaflet Routing Machine documentation](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/api/) and [tutorials](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/tutorials/)
* [ ] You have looked through existing issues

Also, are you making a feature request, or are you in need of more advanced support?
Please consider **sponsoring development**, or paying for support. Not only will this most likely solve your issue quickly,
it's also an awesome way to keep open source projects alive and maintained, as well as giving something back for the
open source you're using. Contact me at per@liedman.net for more information.
